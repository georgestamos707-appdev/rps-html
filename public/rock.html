  <p>
  " Rock-paper-scissors (also known as paper, scissors, stone or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. "

  </p>

  <p>
  <p> These shapes are: </p>
  

  <ul>
    <li>
      ::marker
    " "rock" (a closed fist) "
    </li>

    <li>
     " " paper" (a flat hand) "
    </li>
    <li>
    ::marker
    <li>
      ::marker
      " "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V) "
    </li>

  </ul>

  <p>
   " A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has
    chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts
    scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers
    rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors
    cut[s] paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied
    and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. "

    English-speaking world include roshambo and other orderings of the three
